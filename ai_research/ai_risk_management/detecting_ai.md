# Detecting AI Usage Within a Company: Strategies and Best Practices

## Overview
As AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, organizations need comprehensive strategies to detect, monitor, and govern AI usage. This includes both sanctioned AI tools and "shadow AI" - unauthorized AI applications that employees may be using without IT oversight.

## Comprehensive AI Inventory and Discovery

### Initial Assessment
You should always perform a comprehensive inventory of existing AI tools and applications within the company. This involves:

- **Departmental Engagement**: Identify AI tools across all departments:
  - Customer service (chatbots, sentiment analysis)
  - Marketing (predictive analytics, content generation)
  - HR (resume screening, candidate matching)
  - Finance (fraud detection, automated accounting)
  - Sales (lead scoring, CRM automation)
  - IT/Security (threat detection, log analysis)
  - Legal (contract analysis, compliance monitoring)

- **License and Subscription Audit**: Review software licenses and subscriptions for AI-related tools
- **Network and System Audits**: Work with IT to audit systems and networks for AI software and services
- **API Usage Analysis**: Monitor API calls to AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, etc.)

### Shadow AI Detection
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitor for connections to known AI service endpoints
- **Browser Extension Monitoring**: Detect AI-powered browser extensions and plugins
- **Cloud Service Usage**: Audit cloud service logs for AI/ML service consumption
- **Employee Surveys**: Conduct regular surveys about AI tool usage
- **Expense Report Analysis**: Review expense reports for AI service subscriptions

## AI Bill of Materials (AI BOMs)

I [published an article](https://becomingahacker.org/artificial-intelligence-bill-of-materials-ai-boms-ensuring-ai-transparency-and-traceability-82322643bd2a) that explains AI BOMs in detail. 

### AI BOM vs SBOM
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)**: Document software application components
- **AI Bill of Materials (AI BOMs)**: Document AI system components including:
  - Model details and architecture
  - Training data sources and characteristics
  - Usage patterns and access controls
  - Performance metrics and limitations
  - Bias and fairness assessments
  - Security and privacy considerations

### AI BOM Implementation
- **Model Registry**: Maintain a centralized registry of all AI models
- **Data Lineage Tracking**: Document data sources and transformations
- **Version Control**: Track model versions and updates
- **Risk Assessment**: Document potential risks and mitigation strategies

## Technical Detection Methods
